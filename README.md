# Resume Builder

I have also found creating a website to be a pain.  As does everyone, my first resume was done in Microsoft Word.  This was fine and after you spent a few hours getting every little detail the way you want, you print out a few copies and feel happy with yourself.

Then, as life goes on, you do more stuff.  You try to add a bullet, but the entire word document changes and you spend more time rearranging everything the way you want.  To be honest, its a pain!

I wanted a way to separate my style and format from my content, make way for Jinja templateing with HTML.  I simply put all my data in JSON files, and parse that data to the HTML.

## To use

1. Update the JSON files to match your resume
2. ```python run.py```
